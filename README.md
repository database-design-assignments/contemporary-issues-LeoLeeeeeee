# Data and Health
In this document, I discuss two articles about using big data to analyze people’s health. Two articles proposed contradicting views on this critical matter.

## Article 1
In _Datapine_'s [18 Examples Of Big Data Analytics In Healthcare That Can Save People](https://www.datapine.com/blog/big-data-examples-in-healthcare/), the author discusses various perspectives that big data can be used to save people’s lives. For example, the local hospital could predict how many patients will come on a specific day by analyzing the big data, and they could know how many doctors and medical resources are required on that day. Therefore, the hospital will not face the problem of wasting resources, and all the patients can get taken care of.  

Also, the doctor can easily keep track of each patient’s status. There is a possibility that big data can cure cancer while analyzing the big data and looking for treatments that have the highest rate of success. With big data, the next global pandemic might be controlled in a short amount of time if the government could keep track of each individual who is sick and quarantine them. There is no doubt that gathering the data and analyzing them properly can improve people's health. However, this brings to the new problem of people’s privacy.  

## Article 2
Even though big data can indeed improve people’s health, in _The New York Times_’s [Your App Knows You Got Your Period. Guess Who It Told?](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/us/period-apps-health-technology-women-privacy.html?searchResultPosition=4), the author points out that there is an unregulated grey area where people’s personal data is leaked from the database. In some apps, woman’s most private and intimate data, their periods, are shared by other firms for advertising purposes.  

Although the original purpose is to help the researchers have more opportunities to improve female health, the data is not strictly protected. Deven McGraw, the chief regulatory officer of Ciitizen, points out that the user actually agrees on the privacy policies that give the firm permission to share their data before using the app. It is just that most people will not bother to read the policy. This is a good lesson for the customers in this big data era that they should be aware of whether the firm can share and sell their data to other firms while enjoying the benefits of big data.
